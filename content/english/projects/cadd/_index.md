    - description : "Cardiovascular diseases are among the most deadly worldwide, wherein ischemic diseases are the most lethal. Considering the regenerative potetial stimulated by the thyroid hormone over the heart, we use computational biology techniques to select and optimize agonist molecules of the thyroid receptor alpha, through molecular dynamics, aiming to develop potential drugs for the treatment of cardiac injuries."

    # Description
    - description : "The project aims to characterize the orthosteric and allosteric sites of trypanothione reductase enzyme by implementing molecular dynamics technique alongside docking studies of promissing compounds. This oxidoreductase has central role in protecting exclusively trypanossomatid parasites from oxidative damage, revealing itself as an target of interest in the combat of tropical endemic protozoonosis."

    # Description
    - description : "When molecular docking is performed, there is a need to evaluate its results. This is performed by using scoring functions, which are based on different approaches. However, sometimes a scoring function does not perform well in some cases while others do. So, the use of the consensus approach is being well studied to aid to help to fix this issue. Once the behaviour of scoring functions is not linear between each set of complex, it is hard to establish a simple relation between the scoring functions, so that, the use of the artificial intelligence (AI) is being explored, since the AI is capable of implicitly estimating the relation between two or more elements, even if its relationship is complex. Based on this idea, this project aims to develop, implement and validate a molecular docking system that is capable of using AI to aid the therapeutic drug prospecting process. The system is also capable of being imported separately inside another Python3 script, allowing the user to perform easy automation of the molecular docking process."

    # Description
    - description : "The Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as an international public health concern due to its serious symptoms, notably the evidence that has accumulated to conclude that infection during pregnancy is a major cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Parallel to the development of an efficacious vaccine, research on chemotherapy focusing on specific proteins are excellent alternatives for the inhibition of viral replication . The NS5 protein of ZIKV is one of the most important and conserved Flaviviridae enzyme, which contains two domains: a N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) and a C-terminal RNA polymerase. The function of the MTase domain depends on an S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) cofactor that acts as a methyl group donor, and is thus converted to  S-Adenosyl Homocysteine (SAH). The MTase domain methylates the viral RNA and prevents it from being recognized by the host’s immune system.  Therefore, NS5 MTase can be considered a promising target for drug design. This study aims to investigate NS5 MTase domain in complex with SAH (PDB ID: 5NJU) and other ligands by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to design an inhibitor for this enzyme."
