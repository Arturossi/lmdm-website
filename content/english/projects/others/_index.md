    # Description
    - description : "Deinococcus radiodurans is a model microorganism used for DNA repair and anti-oxidation studies because of its extraordinary tolerance to ionizing radiation and other DNA-damaging agents. Several transcriptome analyzes revealed that hundreds of genes are induced and that many other genes are repressed during the recovery of D.radiodurans after irradiation, suggesting that gene regulation is of great importance for the extreme resistance of this microorganism to ionizing radiation. And some of these transcriptome analyzes performed in response to these stresses showed transcribed genes attributed to proteins of undefined (hypothetical) functions, some of which were identified and predicted by molecular modeling by former student Ricardo Zapalla's master's research work in 2017 . In order to proceed with the research, and with the help of computational biology tools, in this work we focus on the contextualization of the possible biological roles of these genes (found in the previous study) by the genetic analysis of the promoter sequences, performing a comparison with sequences conserved in other Gram-positive bacteria and extremophiles, in search of regions responsive to different Sigma regulatory factors of RNA polymerase. And with these analyses, the characterizations of regulatory sequences for different stimuli or stresses may give us clues about possibly new functions in the biology of extremophiles, also with the possibility of discovering functions with potential biotechnological applications."
